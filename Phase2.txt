This means that from the API access we can get information like registration date, deposit date, 
deposit amount, deposit count, total deposit amount, last call date, withdrawal date, withdrawal amount, 
total withdrawal count, total withdrawal amount.
Along with name, last name, customer ID, email, phone number, sub campaign.
